# ADMM-tutorial

This repository contains the code for the tutorial presented at the 2018, Open Science Data Conferenc in Boston.

The slides can be found at  http://www.jbento.info/slides/ADMM_Tutorial_ODSC_2018.pdf

The tutorial covers four different problems. All of them are solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

Two of the examples concern convex optimization problems: SVM and Total Variation Denoising.
Two of the examples concern non-convex optimization problems: Circle packing and solving Sudoky puzzles.

The tutorial, and the code, approach the problems from an angle that leads to the math and code being as simple as possible.
The code is not mean for speed, and the variant of the ADMM that we cover is not the fastest possible one.
